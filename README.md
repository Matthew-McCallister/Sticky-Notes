# Sticky Notes

A simple web app for creating and managing digital sticky notes.

## Summary

Users can create digital "sticky notes" right in the browser. Each note can be typed into, moved around the screen, edited, or deleted. Notes are automatically saved in the browser so they persist even if you close and reopen the tab.

This app teaches core frontend concepts including:

- Dynamic UI updates with React
- Type-safe development with TypeScript
- Utility-based styling with Tailwind CSS
- Local data persistence using `localStorage`
- Modern tooling with Vite
